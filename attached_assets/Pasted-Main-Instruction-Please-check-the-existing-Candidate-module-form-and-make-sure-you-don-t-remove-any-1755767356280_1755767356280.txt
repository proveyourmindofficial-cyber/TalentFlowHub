Main Instruction

Please check the existing Candidate module form and make sure you don‚Äôt remove any current fields ‚Äî only add the new or missing ones.

The form should be neat, clean, and well-structured, with proper sections and layout.

Use correct field names and include a document upload option.

Where possible, allow advanced features like uploading multiple documents.

First, review the current Candidate form and suggest how we can make it more advanced, professional, and user-friendly (e.g., modern animated Gen-Z style UI).

(If needed, we can do the UI polishing later.)

When suggesting, don‚Äôt just give ideas ‚Äî please provide a working flow with field validations and logic that will work in real use cases (not dummy/assumptions).

For example: if we add fields like PAN or Aadhaar, they must have proper validations (I shouldn‚Äôt even need to remind you of this ‚Äî you know better). If I say ‚Äúmake it advanced,‚Äù you should already know what to implement.

Small Confirmation (External Candidates)

I want to add one more feature if possible: when adding a candidate, there should be an option to select Internal or External.

Internal: Current fields and flow should remain as they are.

External: The below fields should be displayed (in proper font, format, and style). Add advanced/required validations where needed, same as above.
