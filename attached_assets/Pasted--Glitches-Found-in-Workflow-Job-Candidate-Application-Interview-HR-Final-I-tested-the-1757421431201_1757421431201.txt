📌 Glitches Found in Workflow (Job → Candidate → Application → Interview → HR → Final)

I tested the end-to-end process and found several issues. Let me explain step by step:

1. Job & Candidate Creation

I added a Job.

I added a Candidate.

I applied the candidate to the job (created an Application).

✅ Candidate received an email with Interested / Not Interested buttons.

Issue Found:

When I clicked Interested, the status in the application moved to Shortlisted (good), and in the candidate profile the status updated to Interested Candidate (good).

2. Interview Scheduling – L1

I selected the application, scheduled an Interview (L1) for today.

✅ In the Candidate profile, status updated to Interview.

✅ In the Application, status remained Shortlisted.

Issue Found:

❌ The candidate did not receive any email about the scheduled interview.

3. Interview Update – L1 → L2

I changed the interview stage from L1 → L2.

Issue Found:

❌ No email notification sent.

❌ No clear status update in either Candidate or Application.

4. HR Round

I selected the HR round (salary discussion).

After HR round is completed, the status should ideally move to Final / Completed.

Issue Found:

❌ No email notification sent.

❌ No update/change in Application status.

❌ Candidate profile also did not reflect any proper HR → Final → Completed progression.

🔎 Key Problems Identified

Email Triggers Missing

Candidate receives email at “Interested/Not Interested” stage.

But no email is triggered for Interview Scheduling, Interview Stage updates (L1 → L2), HR Round, or Final status.

Status Inconsistencies

Application status stays at Shortlisted even after interviews are scheduled.

Candidate profile shows some updates, but not consistent with Application.

HR → Final → Completed does not trigger any proper change.

Workflow Gaps

End-to-end flow is incomplete: Jobs → Candidate → Application → Interview → HR → Final.

Missing clear mappings between Candidate module and Application module.

Missing audit logs of actions (who updated, when, and what).

✅ What I Need From You

Please check the complete workflow end-to-end:

Jobs Module → Candidate Application → Email Trigger → Status Update

Application Module → Interview Scheduling → Stage-wise Progression → HR Round → Final Status

Candidate Module → Consistent updates across all steps

Email System → Verify all expected triggers

Provide me with detailed documentation (like a book/manual) explaining:

How the workflow is designed (end-to-end logic).

What happens at each stage (status updates, emails, logs).

How Candidate, Application, and Job modules are connected.

Where the current gaps are and how to fix them.

Final plan to ensure no missing statuses or emails.

🎯 Expected Output From You

A clear explanation of how the system is structured, developed, configured, and written (all workflows + logics).

A detailed flow document that I can read and use to test each step.

A list of issues you found in my testing.

The solutions to fix those issues, and why they occurred in the first place.
