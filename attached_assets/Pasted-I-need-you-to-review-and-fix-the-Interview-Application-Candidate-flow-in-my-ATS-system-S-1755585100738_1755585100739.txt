I need you to review and fix the Interview → Application → Candidate flow in my ATS system.

### Step 1: Check Current Flow
1. When a new interview is scheduled (L1/L2/HR/Final), verify:
   - Applications stage updates instantly (e.g., "L1 Scheduled", "Selected").
   - Candidate status updates to "Interviewing".
   - Dashboard counters update without page refresh.
2. Verify if the same candidate is still visible in the interview scheduling lookup after already being scheduled for that round.
3. Verify if interviewer feedback (text) is being saved and displayed correctly in both Interviews and Applications.
4. Verify if candidate status changes automatically when Final interview result is updated.

### Step 2: Fix Issues
1. **Candidate Filtering**
   - When scheduling a new interview, only show candidates who:
     - Have an active application.
     - Are not already scheduled or cleared for that specific round.
   - Example: Candidate cleared L1 should not appear again in L1 dropdown, but can appear for L2.

2. **Feedback Integration**
   - Add a proper text box for interviewer notes/feedback.
   - Save it and display in:
     - Interviews → Feedback column.
     - Applications → Feedback column.

3. **Final Round Automation**
   - If Final Interview → Status = Selected:
     - Application status = "Selected".
     - Candidate status = "Offered".
   - If Final Interview → Status = Rejected:
     - Application status = "Rejected".
     - Candidate status = "Rejected".

4. **Candidate Status Sync**
   - Ensure Candidate does not stay stuck as "Interviewing".
   - After final round, update to "Offered" or "Rejected" accordingly.

### Step 3: Confirm Working
- Test flow end-to-end:
  - Create Application → Schedule L1/L2/HR/Final interviews.
  - Update status + feedback at each step.
  - Check if Applications, Candidates, and Interviews are always in sync automatically without refresh.
- Fix any mismatches so the whole workflow is consistent.

Make sure all fixes are implemented cleanly in both backend logic and UI updates.
