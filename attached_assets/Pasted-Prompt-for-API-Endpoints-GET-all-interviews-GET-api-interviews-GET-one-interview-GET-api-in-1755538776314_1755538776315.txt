Prompt for API Endpoints
// GET all interviews
GET /api/interviews

// GET one interview
GET /api/interviews/:id

// CREATE interview
POST /api/interviews
  { application_id, round, scheduled_date, mode, interviewer, feedback, status }

// UPDATE interview
PUT /api/interviews/:id

// DELETE interview
DELETE /api/interviews/:id

✅ Prompt for Interview Form (Frontend)
Sections:
1. Basic Info: Application (lookup), Round, Scheduled Date, Mode
2. Details: Interviewer, Feedback
3. Status: Dropdown [Scheduled, Completed, Cancelled, Feedback Pending]


👉 Step 1: Copy-paste the DB schema prompt into Supabase SQL editor.
Then we’ll move to API → Form → Table step by step.

Do you want me to bundle all Interview module prompts in one full script (DB + API + UI) or keep giving one-by-one so it’s safer?

sorry to distrub i think did we connected to supabase i think not why you jumping and mix and getting confusion bro ...whats you problem ?
ChatGPT said:

You’re absolutely right 👍 — thanks for catching that.
We did not yet fully connect Supabase. Right now, what we built (Jobs, Candidates, Applications) is still running on local PostgreSQL (via Replit db push), not Supabase.

That’s why you’re feeling confusion — I mixed both. My mistake 🚫

🔄 Correct Order (No Confusion)

Confirm Current DB → We’re on PostgreSQL (local / Replit), ✅ not Supabase yet.

Decide Timing → Either:

(A) Finish all modules locally → then migrate to Supabase,

(B) Connect Supabase now → so everything from here will save directly in cloud.

👉 Best & safest: Finish core skeleton locally (Jobs, Candidates, Applications, Interviews).
Then, when stable, we do one-time Supabase migration. That avoids breaking flow and saves credits.

So next step (before Interview module):
✅ Confirm DB = PostgreSQL (local).
✅ Build Interview table + API + UI in local first.
✅ Later, migrate everything to Supabase in one go.

Do you want me to continue Interview module for local PostgreSQL first (safe flow), or do you want me to pause here and connect Supabase before adding new modules?

ChatGPT said:

Perfect 👍 got it.
So we’ll stay on local PostgreSQL for now (no Supabase yet), finish the Interview module, and then later we’ll migrate everything in one go.

🔹 Step 1: Interview Table (PostgreSQL Schema)
create table interviews (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  application_id uuid not null references applications(id) on delete cascade,
  interview_round text not null, -- e.g., L1, L2, HR, Final
  interviewer text not null,     -- interviewer name/email
  mode text not null,            -- Online, Offline
  scheduled_date timestamp not null,
  feedback text,
  status text default 'Scheduled', -- Scheduled, Completed, Selected, Rejected, On Hold
  created_at timestamp default now(),
  updated_at timestamp default now()
);

🔹 Step 2: API Endpoints

GET /api/interviews → list all interviews

GET /api/interviews/:id → single interview

POST /api/interviews → create new

PUT /api/interviews/:id → update

DELETE /api/interviews/:id → delete

🔹 Step 3: Interview Form (Frontend)

Fields in form:

Application (lookup from Applications table)

Interview Round (dropdown: L1, L2, HR, Final)

Interviewer

Mode (dropdown: Online, Offline, In-Person)

Scheduled Date/Time

Feedback

Status (Scheduled, Completed, Selected, Rejected, On Hold)

🔹 Step 4: Interview Table View (Frontend)

Columns:

Candidate (auto from application → candidate lookup)

Job (auto from application → job lookup)

Round

Interviewer

Mode

Date/Time

Status

Actions (View, Edit, Delete)

✅ Once this is in place, we’ll have Job → Candidate → Application → Interview complete flow ready.

👉 Do you want me to give you the Replit AI prompt for this full Interview module (schema + API + form + table) so you can just copy-paste and run?

You said:
Yeah pleas go ahead
ChatGPT said:

Perfect 🚀 here’s the ready-to-use Replit AI prompt for the Interview Module.
Just copy-paste this into Replit AI, it will generate schema, APIs, frontend form & table:

📌 Replit AI Prompt – Interview Module

Hi Replit AI,

We are continuing to build our TalentFlowHub ATS. The next module is Interviews. Follow the same structure as Jobs, Candidates, and Applications.

Rules

Do not rename or remove fields.

Keep the UI simple (form + table view).

Always link modules correctly with foreign keys.

Respect role-based access (Recruiter, Manager, HR).

Use same style as existing modules.

1. Database Schema (PostgreSQL)
create table interviews (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  application_id uuid not null references applications(id) on delete cascade,
  interview_round text not null,       -- L1, L2, HR, Final
  interviewer text not null,           -- interviewer name or email
  mode text not null,                  -- Online, Offline, In-Person
  scheduled_date timestamp not null,
  feedback text,
  status text default 'Scheduled',     -- Scheduled, Completed, Selected, Rejected, On Hold
  created_at timestamp default now(),
  updated_at timestamp default now()
);

2. API Endpoints

GET /api/interviews → list all interviews

GET /api/interviews/:id → get single interview

POST /api/interviews → create interview

PUT /api/interviews/:id → update interview

DELETE /api/interviews/:id → delete interview

Use Zod validation on all requests.

3. Interview Form (Frontend)

Fields to include:

Application (lookup from Applications table, show Candidate + Job together)

Interview Round (dropdown: L1, L2, HR, Final)

Interviewer (text input)

Mode (dropdown: Online, Offline, In-Person)

Scheduled Date/Time (date-time picker)

Feedback (textarea)

Status (dropdown: Scheduled, Completed, Selected, Rejected, On Hold)

4. Interview Table View (Frontend)

Columns to display:

Candidate (via application → candidate lookup)

Job (via application → job lookup)

Interview Round

Interviewer

Mode

Scheduled Date/Time

Status (badge)

Actions (View, Edit, Delete)

👉 After this, confirm the module works end-to-end:

Create an interview for an existing application

Edit feedback & status after completion

View interviews in table with candidate/job details

Do you want me to also prepare a cross-check prompt (like before) so you can test if Replit built it correctly once done?

You said:
now i need give only this "create table interviews (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  application_id uuid not null references applications(id) on delete cascade,
  interview_round text not null,       -- L1, L2, HR, Final
  interviewer text not null,           -- interviewer name or email
  mode text not null,                  -- Online, Offline, In-Person
  scheduled_date timestamp not null,
  feedback text,
  status text default 'Scheduled',     -- Scheduled, Completed, Selected, Rejected, On Hold
  created_at timestamp default now(),
  updated_at timestamp default now()
);"
ChatGPT said:

Good question 👍

No bro, don’t give only the create table query.
If you just paste that, Replit will only create the table in Supabase/Postgres and stop there.

But what we need is the full module (DB + API + UI). That’s why I wrote the full Interview Module Prompt for you — so Replit generates:

Database schema (your create table ✅)

API endpoints (CRUD for interviews)

Frontend form (to create/edit interview)

Frontend table (to list interviews with candidate/job lookup)

👉 So the correct way is: give the entire prompt I wrote above.
That way Replit won’t skip APIs or UI, and it will build everything together in one flow.

⚡ If you want step-by-step (safe way), we can do:

First run the create table interviews... in Supabase migration

Then add APIs

Then add UI

But the best and proper way (since you said you’ll just follow me) → give the full prompt, not just the SQL.

Do you want me to break it into Step 1 (DB) → Step 2 (API) → Step 3 (UI) prompts separately so you paste one by one?

You said:
then you hvae to give full prompt right
ChatGPT said:

Exactly 👍 You’re right.
I’ll always give you the full prompt so you can just copy–paste into Replit AI without missing pieces.

Here’s the full prompt for the Interview Module (step-by-step, including your create table):

📌 Prompt to Replit AI

Hi Replit AI,
We are now building the Interview Module for our ATS (TalentFlowHub).
Follow the same rules as before (DB + API + Form + Table, no assumptions).

1. Database Schema (PostgreSQL / Supabase)
create table interviews (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  application_id uuid not null references applications(id) on delete cascade,
  interview_round text not null,       -- L1, L2, HR, Final
  interviewer text not null,           -- interviewer name or email
  mode text not null,                  -- Online, Offline, In-Person
  scheduled_date timestamp not null,
  feedback text,
  status text default 'Scheduled',     -- Scheduled, Completed, Selected, Rejected, On Hold
  created_at timestamp default now(),
  updated_at timestamp default now()
);

2. API Endpoints

GET /api/interviews → list all interviews

GET /api/interviews/:id → get single interview

POST /api/interviews → create interview

PUT /api/interviews/:id → update interview

DELETE /api/interviews/:id → delete interview

✅ Make sure each interview links to an application_id, and through that, we can see the job + candidate.

3. Frontend Form (React + Tailwind + RHF + Zod)

Sections inside form:

Interview Round → dropdown (L1, L2, HR, Final)

Interviewer → text/email input

Mode → dropdown (Online, Offline, In-Person)

Scheduled Date → date-time picker

Feedback → textarea

Status → dropdown (Scheduled, Completed, Selected, Rejected, On Hold)

Application → lookup dropdown (list applications with Candidate + Job name)

4. Frontend Table (List UI)

Columns:

Candidate Name (from linked application)

Job Title (from linked application)

Interview Round

Mode

Scheduled Date

Status (badge with colors)

Actions (View / Edit / Delete)

5. Integration

Add Interview statistics card on Dashboard (e.g., Total Interviews, Scheduled, Completed).

Ensure the workflow is connected: Job → Candidate → Application → Interview.

⚡ Final Reminder:
Do not assume any extra fields. Follow my schema + flow exactly.

✅ This will give you everything in one go (DB + API + Form + Table + Dashboard card).

Do you want me to also prepare the step-by-step split prompts (DB first → API → UI) so you can paste them one by one safely?
