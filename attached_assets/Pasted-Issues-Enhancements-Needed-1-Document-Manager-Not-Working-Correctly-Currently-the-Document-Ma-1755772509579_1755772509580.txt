Issues & Enhancements Needed
1. Document Manager (Not Working Correctly)

Currently, the Document Manager button has no functionality.

We need to redesign it so documents can be uploaded by category/section.

Example structure:

Experience Details: Enter experience info + upload relevant docs (Offer Letter, Experience Letter, Bank Statement, etc.)

Education Details: Enter qualification info + upload supporting certificates.

Basic / Government Details: Aadhaar, PAN, UAN, Passport, etc. with validations.

Additional Documents: Any extra or optional uploads.

Each section should have its own fields + document upload option for clarity.

2. Candidate Skill Set (Internal & External)

Right now, the Skill Set field is very basic (single text field).

We need to make it advanced:

Allow multiple skills per candidate.

Each skill should be stored so that a candidate can be applied to multiple roles/JDs based on their different skills.

Add option to manage/update skill sets centrally so recruiters can reuse them.

3. Dynamic Dropdowns (Still Not Updated)

Some fields are still plain text inputs instead of dropdowns with add/manage options.

Please fix this as planned:

Current Company, Locations, Departments â†’ Dropdown + ability to add new values instantly.

These values should be saved and available for all recruiters (centralized).

Example: If a recruiter types a new company name, it should get added to the company list and be available for the next time.

4. External Candidate Form (Enhancements)

Recruiter Name â†’ Should default to the logged-in userâ€™s name.

Client Name â†’ Should be linked to the Client module, with an option to add new clients directly from this field if not already in the system.

National / Regional Options â†’ Keep as dropdowns with editable/addable options.

Education & Experience Fields â†’ Should have both input fields and document upload linked to them.

My Expectation

Make the forms structured, advanced, and dynamic (not just static text fields).

Ensure centralized data for all recruiters.

Document Manager should be section-based, with real functionality, not dummy buttons.

Dropdowns should support dynamic additions and be reusable across modules.

Everything should be clean, neat, and well-organized with proper UI layout.

ðŸ‘‰ Once you check this, please suggest if you see additional improvements we can add â€” I want this to be advanced, professional, and future-ready.
