⚠️ Please do not create a new module.
Just fix / update the existing salary breakdown logic & UI to match Keka Portal format. If you already built something earlier with Indian Standard (40/20/30) logic → delete/remove it completely and re-update this one correctly.

🔎 Current Issue (From Portal Screenshot)

Salary breakup is still using Indian Standard (Basic 40%, HRA 20%, Special Allowance 30%) ❌.

Wrong fields: Special Allowance, Other Benefits.

Wrong deductions: Income Tax hardcoded, PT added wrongly.

Net Take-home calculation does not match Keka.

✅ What It Should Be (Follow Keka Format Exactly)

Structure: Show both Monthly & Annual like Keka.

Earnings:

Basic (fixed % or set value)

HRA (40% of Basic)

Leave Encashment & Additional Allowance

Leave Travel Allowance (LTA)

Subtotal (sum of above)

PF – Employer (max ₹1,800/month = ₹21,600/year)

Total Earnings (Subtotal + Employer PF) = CTC

Deductions:

PF – Employee (same as Employer PF)

Total Deductions

Net Pay:

(Total Earnings − Employee PF)

Monthly & Annual values must display side by side

🔑 Implementation Notes

Use Keka as reference – mirror exact fields, layout, and calculation flow.

Show Monthly & Annual columns clearly.

Flexi / Other Benefits → remove (not part of Keka structure).

Do not add Income Tax or PT manually – those are handled separately by payroll.

Ensure PF capped at ₹1,800/month.

Do not create new code modules – only update/replace existing breakdown logic & UI.

🎯 Example (₹6,00,000 CTC like Keka)

Earnings (Monthly / Annual):

Basic = 30,000 / 3,60,000

HRA = 12,000 / 1,44,000

Leave Encashment & Addl. Allowance = 3,200 / 38,400

LTA = 3,000 / 36,000

Subtotal = 48,200 / 5,78,400

PF Employer = 1,800 / 21,600

Total = 50,000 / 6,00,000

Deductions (Monthly / Annual):

PF Employee = 1,800 / 21,600

Total = 1,800 / 21,600

Net Pay = 46,400 / 5,56,800

📌 Final Note:
👉 Please remove/overwrite the old Indian standard logic (don’t keep both).
👉 The UI + calculation must look exactly like Keka with Monthly & Annual side by side.
