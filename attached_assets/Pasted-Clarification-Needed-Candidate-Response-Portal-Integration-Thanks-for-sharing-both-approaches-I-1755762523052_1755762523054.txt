Clarification Needed: Candidate Response & Portal Integration

Thanks for sharing both approaches. I need some more detailed clarification before I decide:

Current Flow (Working Now)

Candidate clicks Interested → Simple confirmation page

Candidate clicks Not Interested → Simple rejection page

No login required, response tracked in database

Alternative Flow (Candidate Portal Integration)

Candidate clicks Interested → Redirects to Candidate Portal

Auto-creates portal account if needed

Candidate can:

View job applications

Upload documents

Track application status

Complete profile info

Communicate with recruiters

My Questions (Please answer all in detail)

Feedback Collection

Currently, feedback is missing.

Can we add a short feedback form for both Interested and Not Interested responses?

How will this feedback be stored (in Candidate module, Application module, or a new table)?

Document Handling

If the portal is used, how will we collect additional candidate documents (offer acceptance, PAN, Aadhaar, payslips, experience letters, etc.)?

To which module/form will these documents be linked — Candidate, Application, or both?

Can we configure document categories (e.g., Identity Proof, Salary Proof, Resume, etc.)?

Status Updates

When a candidate clicks Interested, how will the status update in both:

Candidate module (Available → Applied / Shortlisted / Interested?)

Application module (Submitted → Applied / Shortlisted?)

Similarly, for Not Interested, what exact statuses will be set in Candidate and Application modules?

Do we need to add new status fields (e.g., “Waiting for Confirmation” or “Rejected by Candidate”) or should we reuse the existing statuses?

Portal Account Creation

When auto-creating a Candidate Portal account, how are credentials generated and shared?

Will the candidate get a Welcome Email with login details automatically?

If they already exist in the system, how is duplication avoided?

Integration Logic

If we adopt a hybrid approach (Interested → Portal, Not Interested → Simple page), how will this affect existing automation?

Can we ensure no breakage of current flows (status updates, filters, automations)?

Will any new fields be added to Candidate/Application modules to track this flow?

Candidate Form Limitations

Currently, the Candidate form only collects basic details + CV.

Do we need to expand it to include:

More personal info fields (PAN, Aadhaar, UAN, etc.)

Professional/Experience details

Bank & compliance details

Or should these be captured later through the portal?

Application–Candidate Linkage

If a candidate applies to multiple JDs, how will the system handle statuses and documents?

Will the candidate’s feedback/status apply to all applications or just the specific one?

Decision Needed

Before we proceed, I need your confirmation:

Should we keep the simple flow,

Or integrate the Candidate Portal for Interested responses,

Or go for full portal integration (Interested & Not Interested both)?

And based on that, please explain how each of the above points will work in detail.
