Menu Duplication & Formatting

In the left sidebar, modules like Applications0, Interviews0 are showing 0 directly attached (no spacing â†’ looks like a bug).

Should display as Applications (0), Interviews (0) â†’ cleaner and more readable.

Inconsistent Spacing

Some menu items have proper spacing (like Jobs 1, Candidates 1), but others are missing parentheses or spacing.

Consistency issue in sidebar UI.

Hierarchy Confusion

"Admin" section is just showing User Management â€” but in the screenshot, the user logged in is Director, not Admin.

Roles/permissions are unclear â†’ Directors shouldnâ€™t see Admin-only options unless explicitly allowed.

Tab Design

On top of "Settings" â†’ you have Company Profile | Email Management | User Management tabs.

They are plain radio-style toggles, not highlighted clearly â†’ difficult to know which one is active.

Suggestion: Use colored underline / bold active state for clarity.

Form Layout

Fields like Website, Industry, Founded Year, Company Size are just plain text inputs.

Some of these should be dropdowns or pickers (e.g., Industry, Company Size).

Example: Company Size could be a predefined dropdown (1â€“10, 11â€“50, 51â€“200, 200+).

Company Logo URL

Right now itâ€™s a text box with a long Google Drive link â†’ not user-friendly.

Better: Show an image preview of the uploaded logo + option to re-upload.

UI Alignment

The tagline field is short while company name is long â†’ they look misaligned.

Need better grid alignment (2-column layout with equal widths).

General Modernization

The form looks plain, no section dividers.

Could use cards/sections with icons for: Basic Info, Company Branding, Contact Details.

Right now it looks like one big flat form.

âœ… Suggested Fixes

Sidebar: Standardize counts â†’ (0) format.

Role visibility: Only show Admin options if logged-in user has Admin role.

Tabs: Add highlight/active color state.

Fields: Convert Industry & Company Size into dropdowns.

Logo: Replace URL field with upload + preview.

Layout: Align fields into neat 2-column sections.

UX polish: Add animations (expand/collapse for sections), consistent spacing, Gen-Z styled subtle hover effects.

ðŸ‘‰ In short: The biggest issues are sidebar duplication/formatting, missing dropdowns, and lack of clean role-based visibility.
