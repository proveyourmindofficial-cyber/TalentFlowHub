ðŸ“˜ Request: End-to-End Application Testing (Front-End / End User Perspective)
ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

I need a complete testing of the application from scratch to end, but only from the end user perspective (front-end) â€” not backend or code-level. The idea is to test it the same way a manual user (recruiter, HR, candidate, etc.) would use the system, so we can identify gaps, bugs, and missing workflows before deployment.

âœ… Scope of Testing

End-to-End Flow

Start from the very beginning (whichever is the first logical step: Job creation, Candidate entry, or Application setup).

Cover the entire lifecycle until the final outcome (offer letter, rejection, or candidate joining).

Manual User Simulation

Use the application as if you are a real user (clicking buttons, filling forms, navigating modules).

No backend or database checks â€” focus only on what the end user sees and does.

Functional Testing

Verify every button, form, status change, and notification.

Example: schedule interview â†’ check email sent â†’ status updated â†’ feedback recorded.

Workflow Validation

Check all status transitions (Applied â†’ L1 Scheduled â†’ L1 Completed â†’ L2 â†’ HR â†’ Offer/Reject).

Make sure each stage triggers the right updates across linked modules (Jobs, Applications, Candidates, Dashboard).

Gap & Bug Identification

Note down any gaps, missing features, incorrect status flows, or bugs.

Example: If L1 is completed but no email is sent, record this clearly.

Notifications & Emails

Verify whether system-generated notifications/emails are being sent properly.

Optionally, I can provide real email IDs for testing. Otherwise, you can use demo/test data â€” let me know what works best.

Candidate Portal (if applicable)

If portal features are enabled, check whether candidate status/feedback/updates reflect correctly.

If not yet active, just document the missing parts for later.

ðŸ“‹ Expected Deliverables

Testing Report (Detailed)

Step-by-step notes of what was tested.

Gaps, issues, and bugs found.

Workflow breakdown (what worked fine, what failed, whatâ€™s missing).

Pros & Cons / Possibilities & Non-Possibilities

Clearly list what works well (strengths).

List current limitations or things not possible in the existing system.

Suggestions on what can be improved immediately vs. what can wait.

Demo-Ready Validation

Testing should ensure the application can be used for a demo purpose without confusion.

The testing report should help me explain the application to others clearly (what happens, where it happens, how it happens).

ðŸš¦ Next Steps After Testing

Once we have the full report of what works, whatâ€™s missing, and whatâ€™s broken:

Fix the issues and close all gaps.

Validate again with final testing.

Move toward deployment and formal announcements.

ðŸ‘‰ In simple terms:

Treat this as manual end-user testing (like a tester).

Check everything end-to-end (front-end only).

Provide a clear report (gaps, bugs, pros/cons).

Help me ensure the application is demo-ready for presentation.
