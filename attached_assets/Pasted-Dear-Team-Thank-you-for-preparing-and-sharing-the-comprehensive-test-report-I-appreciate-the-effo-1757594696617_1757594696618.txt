Dear Team,

Thank you for preparing and sharing the comprehensive test report. I appreciate the effort put into validating the system and highlighting strengths. However, after reviewing it against actual requirements, I found that the approach was more of a “production readiness certificate” rather than the “real end-user QA validation” that was expected.

🔎 Key Gaps in the Testing Approach

The testing mainly confirmed what already works instead of finding what is missing or incomplete.

Did not properly test scratch-to-end workflows like a real user would.

Missed critical issues such as:

❌ Multi-select in Candidate module not working

❌ Bulk operations not tested properly

❌ Advanced interview scenarios (multi-rounds, reschedules, no-shows) not validated

❌ Role-based dashboards & permissions not tested (Admin, Recruiter, HR, Candidate)

❌ All email template variations not validated (Interested, Not Interested, No Show, Offer Rejected, etc.)

✅ What Was Actually Expected

Scratch-to-End Testing:

Check every module (Jobs, Candidates, Applications, Interviews, Offers, BGC, HR, Dashboards) one by one.

For each module: confirm what is there, what is working, what is not there, and what needs modification/removal/addition.

Test all buttons, forms, and workflows like a real end-user.

Real User Perspective (UI + Logic):

What exactly a real user sees and does on the UI.

Verify if the logic behind each action works properly.

Test role-based logins systematically:

Admin: Has full view of all modules and actions

Recruiter: Restricted recruiter functionalities only

HR: HR dashboard, workflows, and restricted actions

Candidate: Candidate portal and actions

Confirm if each role gets the right access and view, and if the Admin can also monitor them.

Gap Analysis Report:

✅ What works

❌ What is missing

⚠️ What is incomplete or buggy

Clear notes on whether a feature needs to be added, modified, or removed

Workflow Logic Testing:

Confirm all paths: Interested → Next Step, Not Interested → Stop, Offer → Acceptance/Rejected/No Show.

End-to-end testing of automation, notifications, and stage progression.

Evidence-Based Reporting:

Include screenshots, step-by-step validation, and real test results — not just summaries.

📝 Next Steps

I request the QA team to:

Re-do testing from scratch, module by module, role by role.

Focus on what’s missing and needs improvement, not just what’s already working.

Deliver a Gap Analysis Table (Module | Feature | Status | Notes).

Validate role-based workflows and dashboards clearly.

Provide evidence-based documentation with screenshots.

📌 Conclusion

While the report was well-prepared, it does not reflect the real end-user experience or cover role-based workflows, missing features, and gaps. The requirement is not just a “system readiness confirmation” but a practical QA validation from a user’s perspective.

Please re-test with this enhanced approach and share a revised report that gives us clarity on both strengths and gaps.
