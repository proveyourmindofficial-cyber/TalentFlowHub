🔥 Implementation Prompt – Candidate Submission + Application Hybrid Flow

Task:
Re-implement the Candidate Submission & Application Email Flow as per the updated hybrid design.
⚠️ Important: Clean up any old or duplicate code related to Candidate Email flow, Application Auto-Creation, or Status updates to avoid conflicts. Keep the existing ATS logic (statuses, workflows, filters, Offer Letter, etc.) intact. Do not override unrelated modules.

📌 Flow Specification
Candidate Submission

Candidate fills the Candidate Form → status = Available.

System triggers an initial Welcome Email:

Subject: “Thanks for sharing your details”

Body: acknowledgement message only (no JD attached).

Recruiter Application Assignment

Recruiter links the Candidate to a JD from the Application module.

Once assigned, the system auto-creates the Application record.

At this point, system sends JD Email:

Includes JD as PDF attachment (from job posting).

Message: “Thanks for applying for this role. Please review the JD and confirm your interest.”

Two action links: Interested / Not Interested.

Candidate Response → Status Updates

If Interested:

Candidate status → Available (remains, but mark as Engaged).

Application status → Applied.

Feedback stored in Candidate profile (e.g., “Confirmed via JD email”).

If Not Interested:

Candidate status → Not Interested.

Application status → On Hold.

Feedback reason captured (short text form).

⚠️ Implementation Notes

Remove any previous automation that:

Auto-created Applications immediately after Candidate Form submission.

Auto-sent JD emails at submission stage.

Keep existing predefined statuses (Applied, On Hold, Not Interested, etc.) — do not introduce new ones unless necessary.

Make sure no duplicate triggers or multiple emails are sent.

All changes should stay isolated to Candidate → Application workflow.

Ensure clean code: no redundant files, functions, or conflicting logic.

✅ End Result:

Candidate submits → Welcome Email only.

Recruiter applies candidate → JD Email triggered.

Candidate response → Status auto-updates in both Candidate & Application modules.

Recruiter workflow stays simple + Candidate experience stays automated.
