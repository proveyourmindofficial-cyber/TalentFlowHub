1. Extend Application Stages

Add these new valid application stages:

Offer Released

Joined

Not Joined

No Show

So the full valid list becomes:
['Applied', 'Shortlisted', 'L1 Scheduled', 'L2 Scheduled', 'Selected', 'Offer Released', 'Joined', 'Rejected', 'No Show', 'Not Joined', 'On Hold']

2. Automation Rules

Update applyInterviewAutomation() so status transitions are correct:

HR + Completed + Selected
→ Application = Selected
→ Candidate = Offered

HR + Completed + Rejected
→ Application = Rejected
→ Candidate = Rejected

HR + Completed + On Hold
→ Application = On Hold
→ Candidate = Interviewing

HR + Completed + No Show
→ Application = No Show
→ Candidate = Available

L1/L2/Final (any status)
→ Application = Shortlisted
→ Candidate = Interviewing

When recruiter clicks "Release Offer"
→ Application = Offer Released
→ Candidate = Offered

When candidate accepts offer
→ Application = Joined
→ Candidate = Joined

When candidate rejects or fails to join
→ Application = Not Joined
→ Candidate = Not Joined

Default fallback
→ Application = Shortlisted
→ Candidate = Interviewing

3. UI Changes

In Applications page, show new stages in dropdown & status badges.

In Candidates page, show status as: Available, Interviewing, Offered, Joined, Rejected, Not Joined.

Add "Release Offer" button on application detail page that moves status from Selected → Offer Released.

4. Email/Offer Letter Placeholder

Add backend endpoint /applications/:id/release-offer

Generates a placeholder Offer Letter PDF (template later).

Sends an email with a dummy "Accept / Reject" link (to be wired later).

5. Data Consistency

Candidate and Application must always stay in sync (no mismatch allowed).

Whenever interview or offer status changes, both must recalculate fresh.

✅ Deliverables

Backend: updated enums, automation rules, API endpoints.

Frontend: dropdowns, badges, Release Offer button.

DB migration if required.

Tested flow:

Candidate reaches Selected

HR clicks Release Offer → Candidate=Offered, Application=Offer Released

Candidate accepts → Candidate=Joined, Application=Joined

Candidate rejects → Candidate=Not Joined, Application=Not Joined

⚡ Output should include full code changes (backend + frontend), updated enums, and clear commit notes.
