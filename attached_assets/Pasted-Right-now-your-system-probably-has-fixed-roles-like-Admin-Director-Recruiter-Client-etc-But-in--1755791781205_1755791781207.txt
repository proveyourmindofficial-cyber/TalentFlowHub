Right now, your system probably has fixed roles like Admin, Director, Recruiter, Client etc.
But in real life, every company works differently → sometimes you may want to:

Create a new role (e.g., Senior Recruiter, HR Intern, Finance Officer)

Control exactly what that role can do (e.g., can view candidates but not edit, can send offer letters but not delete)

That’s why you need a customizable role permission module → so you are not limited to only the pre-built roles.

🔹 How It Works Step by Step

Role Creation

In User Management → “+ Create New Role” button.

Enter: Role Name (e.g., HR Coordinator) and Description.

Permission Assignment

System should list all possible features/modules:

Dashboard

Candidates

Jobs

Applications

Interviews

Offer Letters

Client Requirements

Reports

Settings

For each feature → you define the permissions:

View / Add / Edit / Delete (typical CRUD model)

Or even more granular: Approve, Export, Download, Manage Workflow

✅ Example:

HR Coordinator: Can view candidates, add applications, schedule interviews, but cannot generate offer letters.

Finance Officer: Can view reports, manage invoicing, but cannot access candidate details.

Assign Role to User

When you add a new user (or edit an existing one), you choose from the role list (including custom roles).

Example: Assign HR Coordinator role to Sarah → she instantly gets only the permissions you defined.

Centralized Role Management

If later you edit the role permissions (e.g., add delete permission for Candidates), it applies automatically to all users with that role.

🔹 Benefits

Flexibility → adapt roles to your company’s structure.

Security → no accidental access, only the right people see/manage the right things.

Scalability → if tomorrow you expand, you don’t need new code, just define new roles.

Standardization → same role = same permissions for everyone.

👉 In short:
This module lets you design your own roles (like Lego blocks) instead of being stuck with fixed ones.
