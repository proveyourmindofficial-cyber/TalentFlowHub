In the Candidate module, I see issues with how the statuses and filters are working:

Candidate Status (Available → Applied)

Initially, a candidate shows as Available.

When I apply that candidate to a job (in Applications), the status in the Candidate module should also automatically update to Applied.

This is a basic concept and common workflow standard — when applied, the candidate should no longer remain “Available.”

Duplicate Visibility in Applications

After applying a candidate (e.g., Raju) to a job, that candidate should not appear again when creating a new application.

However, currently, the same candidate still appears in the dropdown list for selection.

This creates duplication and goes against common logic — once applied, they shouldn’t be selectable again.

Duplicate Visibility in Interviews

Similarly, after scheduling a candidate (e.g., Raju) for an L1 interview, when scheduling a new interview for another candidate, I still see Raju in the dropdown.

Logically, once scheduled, that candidate should not reappear for scheduling until the interview process moves forward or ends.

Observations

Status updates between Candidate module and Applications module are inconsistent.

Filters are missing — candidates who are already applied or scheduled are still shown again in dropdowns.

This breaks the expected workflow and adds confusion.

Expected Behavior

Candidate status should update automatically (Available → Applied) once they are used in Applications.

Applied candidates should not be visible again when creating new Applications.

Scheduled candidates should not appear again when scheduling new Interviews.

Filters must ensure only eligible candidates appear at each stage.

Request for Clarification

Please explain what logic is currently being used that allows candidates to still appear after being applied or scheduled.

If you have designed it this way for a specific reason, please justify how it helps in real workflows.

If I am missing something, kindly suggest the correct approach. Otherwise, fix the filters so they align with basic and global ATS concepts.
