üîπ Revised Document Manager Requirement

You don‚Äôt want a single bulk upload area. Instead, you want a well-organized, section-based, detailed Document Manager ‚Äî where each type of information has its own structured entry + its related documents, not just all files in one place.

1. Education Section

Each qualification should be entered separately.

Fields per entry:

Qualification (Dropdown: Degree, Intermediate, Diploma, MBA, etc.)

Institution Name

Passed Out Year

Percentage/CGPA (optional)

Upload relevant document only (e.g., Degree Certificate, Marks Memo).

Candidate can add multiple education entries (Add More button).

2. Employment Section

Each organization should be entered separately.

Fields per employment entry:

Organization Name

Designation

From Date ‚Üí To Date

CTC (Optional)

Location

Document Upload (Multiple allowed per organization):

Offer Letter

Experience Letter

Bank Statement / Salary Slips

PF/ESI related document

Candidate can add multiple employment entries.

3. Identity / Government Details

Fields:

Aadhaar Number + Upload Aadhaar

PAN Number + Upload PAN

Passport Number + Upload Passport (optional)

UAN Number + Upload UAN (if applicable)

Each identity should have its own field + its related upload.

4. Additional / Optional Documents

Category-based uploads:

Resume (CV)

LinkedIn Verification (link + screenshot/doc if needed)

Video Screening (Manager Screening Video link/upload)

Any other supporting documents (customizable).

5. UI / UX Expectations

Clean and well-structured sections (Education, Employment, Identity, Additional).

Each section has sub-entries with fields + documents, not just a flat upload list.

‚ÄúAdd More‚Äù option to allow multiple entries in Education & Employment.

Clear validation: e.g., if "Degree" is selected ‚Üí only Degree Certificate upload allowed.

Professional look (can refine later with animations/UI polish, e.g., GenZ style).

üîπ Difference From Current Flow

Right now ‚Üí Info is collected in one place + docs uploaded in one bulk place.
What you need ‚Üí Each detail and its related documents should live together in one entry, so it‚Äôs clear, traceable, and organized.
