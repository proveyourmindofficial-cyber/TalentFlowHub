Two Types of Jobs

Internal (Company Roles):

Positions are very limited (Recruiter, Operations, Finance, IT, HR).

These JDs are standard, and updates are done by HR (only one person handles this).

No approval process is needed — HR directly uploads or updates these.

External (Client Roles):

Multiple job positions, received from clients via emails.

Account Managers are the ones who get these JDs from management (or admin) and upload them into the portal.

Recruiters do not upload JDs — they only work on JDs shared by their Account Manager.

How It Works Now

Account Managers upload JDs into the portal.

Each Account Manager can decide which JD goes to which recruiter in their team.

Sometimes:

A JD is shared with only one recruiter or one team.

Other times, a JD is common to all recruiters and everyone works on it.

Different Account Managers might get the same JD and share it separately with their teams.

All of this right now is being done via email, which is hard to track.

Problems

No proper tracking of which recruiter is working on which JD.

Sometimes duplicate effort happens (same JD shared by multiple Account Managers).

No visibility for management on who is handling what JD.

Confusion between “common JDs” and “assigned JDs”.

What You’re Asking For

A clear solution for tracking JDs inside the portal:

JDs will still be uploaded only by Account Managers.

But there must be visibility on:

Which JDs exist in the system (a common pool of all JDs)

Which recruiter is assigned to which JD

Which JDs are common (visible to everyone) vs. restricted (assigned to specific recruiter/team)

Suggested Solution

JD Upload Process

Only Account Managers can upload new JDs (as per current setup).

Each JD should have two properties:

Visibility → Common (all recruiters) or Assigned (specific recruiters/teams)

Source → Internal (HR-created) or External (Client via Account Manager)

Assignment Flow

When uploading, Account Manager selects:

If JD is common, it automatically becomes visible to all recruiters.

If JD is assigned, Account Manager chooses which recruiter(s) or team gets it.

Recruiters will then only see:

Common JDs (for all)

Assigned JDs (specifically given to them)

Tracking & Reporting

Admin should be able to see a full JD tracker:

JD → Uploaded by which Account Manager → Assigned to which recruiters → Current status (Open, In-progress, Closed).

Prevent duplication by giving each JD a unique reference ID.

Benefits of This Plan

No more confusion between internal vs external jobs.

No duplication of effort on the same JD.

Recruiters have a clear view of only the jobs they should work on.

Management/Admin can easily track assignments and progress.

✅ This way, you’ll have clarity + control without changing the current process too much (Account Managers still upload, recruiters still work on assigned JDs).
