📢 Feedback on O2F ATS Interview Management System Test Report

Dear Team,

Thanks for preparing and sharing the Comprehensive Test Report (v1.0). While the document is detailed and highlights the strong areas (like email integration, workflow automation, and security testing), after reviewing it and comparing with the actual system usage, I see some serious gaps between the report and the real expectations of end-to-end testing.

✅ What You Captured Well

End-to-end workflows (Job → Candidate → Application → Interview → Offer) are described as tested.

Bugs identified/resolved were well-documented with clear fixes.

Microsoft Graph API email delivery, automation rules, and UI/UX compliance were checked properly.

Performance, security, and database validations are reported as successful.

❌ What Is Missing / Not Covered

However, the report mainly covers what already works, but does not highlight what is missing, not working, or partially working. Examples:

Candidate Module Issues

Multi-select option for candidates is not working.

Buttons and bulk operations not properly validated.

Interview Module

Only one flow (basic scheduling) seems tested.

Advanced cases like multiple interviews, rescheduling, panel interviews, and workflow branching are not covered.

User Management & Role-Based Dashboards

No mention of testing role-based access (Admin, Recruiter, HR, Candidate).

Dashboards for each role not validated.

Permissions and restrictions not tested properly.

Workflow Testing

The report says “100% workflows validated,” but actual gaps are there (e.g., candidate progression logic, interest/not interested flow, rejection handling).

No detail on whether “scratch-to-end” like a real manual user was done.

Feature/Gap Analysis

No checklist of features that are missing or still to be built.

For example: reporting dashboards, self-service admin settings, calendar sync, better error handling.

The report doesn’t distinguish between what exists vs. what should exist.

Email Templates & Notifications

Email templates are confirmed as working, but no mention if all variations (interested/not interested, offer rejected, no show, etc.) were tested.

General Testing Approach

It looks more like a “production readiness certificate” rather than a “real QA test report.”

The spirit of testing from “scratch to end as a manual user” (checking every button, flow, feature, and gap) is missing.

📝 What We Actually Expected

Testing every module one by one (Jobs, Candidates, Applications, Interviews, Offers, BGC, HR, User Management, Dashboards).

Checking all buttons, forms, validations, workflows like a real user would.

Documenting not only bugs but also missing features/gaps.

Confirming role-based workflows and dashboards.

Verifying logic paths (Interested → Next Steps, Not Interested → Stop, etc.).

Providing a clear gap list (what works ✅, what is missing ❌, what is incomplete ⚠️).

🚀 Next Steps (Request to Team)

Re-do testing with a scratch-to-end approach from end-user perspective.

Cover all modules and role-based dashboards.

Provide a gap analysis table (Feature present / Missing / Needs Improvement).

Validate workflow logics and email templates across all possible decision paths.

Include real screenshots and step-by-step results instead of only summary.

📌 Conclusion

While the report is well-written, it does not reflect the real gaps, missing features, and incomplete testing coverage. What we need is not just a certificate of readiness, but a practical QA validation showing both what is working and what is missing.

We request the QA team to enhance the report with complete scratch-to-end testing coverage and provide a revised version.
