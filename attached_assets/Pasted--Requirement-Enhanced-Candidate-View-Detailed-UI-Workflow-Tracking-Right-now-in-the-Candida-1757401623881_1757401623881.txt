📌 Requirement: Enhanced Candidate View (Detailed UI & Workflow Tracking)

Right now, in the Candidate Form, we have a View option that shows some basic information. That’s fine, but what I really need is a more detailed view with a clean and structured UI, so that all relevant information can be accessed in one place.

🔍 Current Gap

The current candidate view shows only basic details.

Missing: Clear visibility of skills, applied jobs, interview/application stages, remarks, and documents.

As an admin/reviewer, I cannot get a complete picture of the candidate’s journey from start to end.

💡 Proposed Enhancements

Detailed Candidate Profile View

Show all fields (basic info, contact, documents, resume, etc.).

Display skills with proficiency, experience, and certifications.

List all jobs applied for with the associated skill(s).

Application & Stage-Wise Tracking

Track and display the full workflow of the candidate:

Application submitted → Screening → Interview rounds → Offer → Joining → Rejection (if any).

Show remarks and comments at each stage.

Highlight the current status (e.g., “Interview Round 2 scheduled”).

Clear Sections & UI Improvements

Separate tabs or blocks for:

Personal Info

Skills & Expertise

Jobs Applied

Interview/Application Stages

Documents & Attachments

Admin Remarks & Feedback

Well-organized layout with better readability.

History & Audit Trail

Complete activity log of the candidate: who added them, which role, changes made, emails sent, status updates.

A timeline view to see the candidate’s journey from start to finish.

✅ Expected Outcome

If I open any candidate’s profile, I should get the entire picture at a glance:

Skills → Jobs applied → Progress in each stage → Remarks → Final outcome.

This will help in monitoring, decision-making, and improving the candidate workflow.

❓ My Questions to You

Is this possible to implement in the current system?

Should it be part of the Candidate Form (View option), or should we build a separate Candidate Detailed Profile Page?

What would be the best approach/UI standard for this (global best practice)?
