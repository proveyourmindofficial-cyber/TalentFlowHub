"I still have some doubts and issues after testing.

1. Department Selection

When I click on Invite User, there is no proper way to select a department.

You only provided a dropdown with 'Add New Department', but itâ€™s not functioning. I donâ€™t get any option to actually add or create a new department.

2. Manager Assignment

For existing users, youâ€™ve given the option to select a manager from the list, which is fine.

But for a new user, there is no option to add or assign a manager. Iâ€™m not clear what your plan is here.

3. Role & Hierarchy Confusion

As I explained earlier, we have roles like Manager â†’ Team Lead â†’ Recruiter.

Example:

A = Manager

B = Team Lead

C = Recruiter

My question: how do we tag this hierarchy correctly in the system? Is it only based on the role, or do we also need a reporting manager field?

4. Practical Example

Letâ€™s say:

Sandeep (Admin)

Sakshi (Team Lead)

Areka (Recruiter)

We already have different permission sets for these roles, which is fine.

But how do I tag Sakshi under Sandeep, and then tag Areka under Sakshi?

Right now, itâ€™s not clear how this reporting structure is supposed to work inside User Management.

Scenario (Hierarchy Requirement)

Letâ€™s take a scenario:

We have 1 Manager with 10 Recruiters reporting to them.

Out of those 10, 2 are Team Leads.

So effectively:

Manager â†’ oversees all 10 recruiters.

Team Lead A â†’ manages 4 recruiters (Team A).

Team Lead B â†’ manages 4 recruiters (Team B).

The remaining 2 recruiters report directly to the Manager.

Requirement: Data Access Based on Hierarchy

Recruiter â†’ Can only see their own data.

Team Lead â†’ Can see their own data + the data of their team members.

Manager â†’ Full access to all 10 recruitersâ€™ data.

This way, data visibility is controlled by hierarchy:

No overlap or unnecessary access.

Reporting lines decide what a user can see and manage.

ðŸ‘‰ The goal is to ensure user-wise data visibility and controlled access based on reporting structure, not just generic roles.

This is why Iâ€™ve been insisting on proper hierarchy mapping inside User Management. Can you explain the exact flow youâ€™re planning to implement for this?"
